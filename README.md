# Git-It-Done-APIs, JavaScript

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a site where the user can find open issues on GitHub. The site allows the user to search by language (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) or by user. The search then fetches data using the GitHub API and returns any repositories with those parameters. The user can then see which repos have open issues, and click through the issues to go to the GitHub page.

## Installation
